            Aryabhata also made contributions to the fields of geometry and algebra in addition to his work in astronomy and mathematics. Here's more information about his contributions to these areas:
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-3 pt-1">Geometry</h3>
        <h4 class="pb-3 pt-2">Properties of Triangles</h4>
        <p>
            Aryabhata worked on various properties of triangles, including their sides and angles. He provided rules for calculating the areas of different types of triangles and discussed relationships between the sides and angles.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-1 pt-3">Geometric Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            He calculated the areas of geometric shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and trapezoids. His work laid the foundation for later developments in geometry in India.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-1 pt-3">Earth's Curvature</h4>
        <p>
            Aryabhata proposed that the Earth is a sphere and calculated its circumference, although his estimation was slightly inaccurate. Nevertheless, this was an important step toward understanding the Earth's shape.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="pb-2 pt-4">Algebra</h3>
        <h4 class="pb-1 pt-3">Quadratic Equations</h4>
        <p>Aryabhata worked on solving quadratic equations, both indeterminate and determinate. He introduced a method for solving quadratic equations using fractions, which was an innovative approach at the time.</p>
        
        <h4 class="pb-1 pt-3">Approximation of π</h4>
        <p>
            He used a value of π as 3.1416, an approximation which was quite accurate given the resources available during his time.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-1 pt-3">Algebraic Manipulations</h4>
        <p>
            Aryabhata's work involved algebraic manipulations, where he demonstrated techniques for simplifying expressions and solving equations involving unknowns.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-1 pt-3">Sums of Series</h4>
        <p>
            He provided rules and formulas for calculating the sums of arithmetic and geometric series, which were useful for various mathematical calculations.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-1 pt-3" id="number-theory">Number Theory</h4>
        <p>
            While not the central focus of his work, Aryabhata's contributions to algebra also touched on number theory concepts, such as divisibility rules and properties of integers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Aryabhata's work in geometry and algebra, although not as extensive as his contributions to astronomy and mathematics, still provided valuable insights and methods that laid the groundwork for later developments in these fields. His approach to algebraic problems and geometric calculations showed his deep understanding of mathematical principles and his ability to apply them to various areas of study.
