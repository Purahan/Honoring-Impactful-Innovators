        <h3 class="pb-3" id="days">Length of the Solar Day</h3>
        <p>
            Aryabhata calculated the length of the solar day, which is the time interval between two successive occurrences of the Sun crossing the same meridian. He arrived at a value of 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds, which is very close to the modern value of the sidereal day. This calculation demonstrates his accurate understanding of Earth's rotation.

        <h3 class="pb-3 pt-5">Length of the Year</h3>
        <p>
            Aryabhata's work included calculations for the length of a year. He estimated the length of a tropical year (the time it takes for the Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun) to be approximately 365.3586805 days, which is quite close to the modern value of around 365.242190 days. This demonstrates his ability to make precise astronomical calculations.

        <h3 class="pb-3 pt-5" id="calendar">Calendars</h3>
        <p>
            Aryabhata discussed various aspects of calendars, including the calculation of leap years. He proposed a calendar system that incorporated both solar and lunar cycles. His work aimed at reconciling the solar year with the lunar month to create a more accurate and practical calendar. This involved the introduction of an intercalary month to adjust for the difference between the two cycles.

        <h3 class="pb-3 pt-5">Yuga System</h3>
        <p>
            Aryabhata introduced the concept of "yugas," which are cyclic time periods in Hindu cosmology. He divided time into four yugas: Krita Yuga (1,728,000 years), Treta Yuga (1,296,000 years), Dvapara Yuga (864,000 years), and Kali Yuga (432,000 years). These yugas constitute a "mahayuga" cycle of 4,320,000 years. Aryabhata's inclusion of these yugas in his work reflects his understanding of the cosmological and spiritual dimensions of time.

            Aryabhata's insights into time and calendars were foundational in Indian astronomy and mathematics. While some of his calculations were not entirely accurate by modern standards, his work laid the groundwork for more precise calculations and improvements in calendar systems by later mathematicians and astronomers in India. His contributions helped shape the way time is measured and calendars are organized in various cultures around the world.
